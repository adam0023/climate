---
Animal agriculture accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or about 7.3 gigatons CO2e annually.  
The remaining carbon budget for 1.5째C warming is around 130 gigatons CO2.  
This calculator estimates proportional emissions savings and added time to the climate threshold based on global veganism adoption.  
Note: This is a simplified estimate ignoring feedback loops and other greenhouse gases.
